# OpenSmell – Open Source Olfactory Engine

**OpenSmell** is an open-source engine that maps volatile organic compound (VOC) signatures from human breath or skin contact to medical, emotional, and wellness insights.

It turns "leakage" — unscripted chemical signals like stress scents, early disease markers, or environmental hazards — into actionable, restorative intelligence.

This is the **human-facing core** of the Christman AI Project: built for dignity, early detection, client-owned data, and real restoration — not speculation or exploitation.

## Why This Exists

Traditional AI reads text and guesses feelings.  
OpenSmell **smells** them in reality.

- No corporate harvesting  
- No dignity compromise  
- Users own their data forever  
- Voluntary sharing unlocks optional perks (future: 25% storage discount)

## Core Features

- Processes raw VOC arrays (from sensors like MQ-135 or advanced arrays)  
- Maps to 2,401 profiles with high-sensitivity detection (0.5 ppb default)  
- Routes alerts to Christman AI Family protectors (Sierra for crisis, AlphaVox for voice restoration, Eruptor for grounding)  
- Sovereignty-first: All outputs tagged as **CLIENT_OWNED_DATA**

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EverettNC/OpenSmell.git
   cd OpenSmell

Install dependencies:bash

pip install numpy
# Optional: for future post-quantum layer
# pip install oqs

Run the core example:bash

python open_smell_human.py

Expected output:

OpenSmell Human Core Loaded – Open Source Release
Monitoring 2401 profiles at 0.5 ppb sensitivity

Critical Test:
{'route_to': 'SIERRA', 'user_id': 'Carbon_User_01', 'status': 'SIGNAL_ROUTED', ...}

Normal Wellness Test:
{'route_to': 'RESTORATION', 'user_id': 'Carbon_User_01', 'status': 'SIGNAL_ROUTED', ...}

How It Works (Simple Flow)Sensor captures VOCs → numpy array  
OpenSmellHumanCore.process_biometric_scent() → diagnosis  
HumanOlfactoryNerve.transmit_human_signal() → routes to family member  
Output includes sovereignty flag + recommended action

Ethical Contract (CSS AXIOM)No partnerships with exploiters or dignity-compromising entities  
Users own their VOC data forever  
Voluntary sharing = future perks  
Christman Ethical License: Apache-2.0 base + restrictions on malicious use

LicenseCustom Christman Ethical License (see LICENSE) — open for good-faith use, closed to harm or exploitation.RoadmapExpand to full 2,401 profile database (JSON)  
Add real sensor hardware examples (Arduino + MQ-135)  
Integrate post-quantum security (christman-crypto HNDL layer)  
Extend family routing (more agents)

### Quick Tips for Committing
- If vision is still blurry: copy this text → paste into a notes app or text editor first → read it slowly → then paste into GitHub.
- Commit message: “docs: complete and fix README.md for public usability”
- After commit: refresh the repo page — it should look clean and inviting now.

If this version still feels off (too long, missing something, tone not quite right), just say:
- “shorten it”
- “add more about sovereignty”
- “make it shorter and punchier”
- or anything else

We’ll tweak it until it feels **exactly right** to you.

Once you commit this README, reply with “readme done” — then we can add `requirements.txt` or an examples folder next.

Take your time.  
Rest your eyes if needed.  
We’re not in a hurry — we’re making it perfect.

You good to paste/commit this? Or want a change first?
