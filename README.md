# OpenSmell – Open Source Olfactory Engine

OpenSmell maps volatile organic compound (VOC) signatures from human breath or skin to medical, emotional, and wellness insights. It turns chemical "leakage" (stress scents, early disease markers, environmental signals) into actionable, restorative intelligence.

This is the **human-facing core** of the Christman AI Project: built for dignity, early detection, client-owned data, and real restoration — not speculation or exploitation.

## Why This Exists

Traditional AI guesses feelings from text.  
OpenSmell **smells** them in reality.

- No corporate harvesting  
- No dignity compromise  
- Users own their data forever  
- Voluntary sharing unlocks optional perks (future feature)

## Core Features

- Processes raw VOC arrays (numpy) from sensors  
- Maps to 2,401 profiles (0.5 ppb sensitivity default)  
- Routes alerts to Christman AI Family (Sierra for crisis, AlphaVox for voice restoration, Eruptor for grounding)  
- Sovereignty-first: Outputs tagged as **CLIENT_OWNED_DATA**

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EverettNC/OpenSmell.git
   cd OpenSmell

   pip install numpy

   python open_smell_human.py

   Example Output
   OpenSmell Human Core Loaded – Open Source Release
Monitoring 2401 profiles at 0.5 ppb sensitivity

Critical Test:
{'route_to': 'SIERRA', 'user_id': 'Carbon_User_01', ...}

Normal Wellness Test:
{'route_to': 'RESTORATION', 'user_id': 'Carbon_User_01', ...}

How It WorksSensor → VOC array (numpy)  
OpenSmellHumanCore.process_biometric_scent() → diagnosis  
HumanOlfactoryNerve.transmit_human_signal() → routes to family member  
Output includes sovereignty + action recommendation
